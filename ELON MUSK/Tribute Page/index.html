     <h5>I am inspired by Elon Musk. Why?
    - Because Elon Musk is a visionary and persistent personality, that is.
    to carry out that vision. Since I was little, I have looked up to him for his determination .So this is tribute page dedicated to him.
    Everyone should have the desire to be successful. His capacity for persistence and commitment in the face of multiple setbacks.¬†
    He stands out from most people who would give up after one or two failed tries at something new because of his failures.
    Elon Musk developed his own standards,not lived up to others' expectations, therefore he is not really a someone who will give it up easily because he invests so much effort to succeed.
    his life's ambitions, which make him an inspiration to people throughout.</h5>
